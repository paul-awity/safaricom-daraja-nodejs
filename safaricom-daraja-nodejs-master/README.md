  ## C2B Payments ##

  This API enables Paybill and Buy Goods merchants to integrate to M-Pesa and receive real time payments notifications.

   ###### Required information ######
   1. Mpesa pay bill short code. MUST have been configured for C2B payments
   2. Create a production application on [Safaricom Developer site ](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke) ensure you check
    against C2B Production under OTP confirmation window when going through the go live steps.
   3. On running the service register the service api end points to Safaricom and then you need to register the end 
   points of your application to this service. This enables it to forward requests to your merchant site when customers 
   initiate payments via STK.

   ###### Service End point registration ######

   When you run this application, you have to configure its end points using a domain name that is accessible over the
   internet. In the properties.json file enter the validation and confirmation urls on the validationURL and 
   confirmationURL keys respectively.Also, add your short code in the shortCode key.

   ```
     "shortCode": "600169",
     "confirmationURL": "https://localhost:3000/v1/payBill/confirmation",
     "validationURL": "https://localhost:3000/v1/account/validation",
   ```

   To initiate this transaction, call a put request to the end point `http://localhost:3000/c2b/register/safaricom`.
   This will initiate a request to Safaricom to register the above configured end points. On successful registration, 
   the response received will be

   **Sample Registration Success Response**

   ```
      {
        "status": "00",
        "message": "success"
      }
   ```

   ###### Merchant End Point Registration ######

   To ensure you receive transactions on your merchant site. You have to register the end points to receive validation
    and confirmation request.

   Send a POST request to the service end point `http://localhost:3000/c2b/register/merchant`

   **Sample Merchant End Point Registration Request**

   ```
      {
        "shortCode": "513833",
        "confirmationURL": "http://localhost:3000/c2b/confirm",
        "validationURL": "http://localhost:3000/c2b/validate"
      }

   ```

   **Sample Registration Success Response**

   ```
      {
        "status": "00",
        "message": "URL registration successful"
      }
   ```

   ###### Account Validation Request ######

   To ensure your customers are paying to the right account, M-Pesa has to send a confirmation request to confirm the 
   existence of an account. This request will be forwarded to the validation end point registered earlier under 
   [ Merchant End Point Registration ](#merchant-end-point-registration  )

   **Sample account validation Request**

   ```
      {
        "transactionType": "PAY BILL",
        "action": "validate",
        "phone": "25470*****",
        "firstName": "JOHN",
        "middleName": "DOE",
        "lastName": "",
        "amount": "5.00",
        "accountNumber": "DSTV12345",
        "time": "2018-02-28 20:46:29"
      }
   ```

   **Sample Account Validation Success Response**

   ```
      {
        "status": "00",
        "message": "Account validation success",
        "transactionId":"MERCHANT09822FEES"
      }
   ```

   **Sample Account Validation Failed Response**

   ```
      {
        "status": "01",
        "message": "Account provided is invalid",
        "transactionId":""
      }
   ```

   ###### Transaction Confirmation Request ######

   To confirm the customer's has deposited funds into your merchant pay bill, Safaricom initiates this transaction 
   through the service to the confirmation url initially registered. This request may take time to arrive after 
   sending the initial transaction request. This request will be forwarded to the validation end point registered earlier
    under [ Merchant End Point Registration ](#merchant-end-point-registration  )

   **Sample Confirmation Request**

   ```
   {
     "transactionType": "Pay Bill",
     "action": "confirmation",
     "phone": "254706151592",
     "firstName": "BEN",
     "middleName": "MUUO",
     "lastName": "",
     "OrgAccountBalance": "1995.00",
     "amount": "5.00",
     "accountNumber": "HRE668807",
     "transID": "MBQ9YFXP8E",
     "time": "2018-02-26 20:46:39"
   }

   ```

   **Sample Confirmation Response**

   ```
    {
      "status": "00",
      "message": "Success"
    }
   ```

  The confirmation transaction indicates the customer has been charged successfully.
